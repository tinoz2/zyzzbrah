        <p class="parrafo media">The process of <span class="spanb">wine</span> production has hardly changed since its inception over 6,000 years ago. The method and technique are the same for red, white, or rosé <span class="spanb">wine</span>. What varies are certain aspects such as fermentation time and temperature, as well as the choice of grape variety and its components. The harvest is done by hand, cutting the grapes with special scissors that only sever the cluster, avoiding damage to the plant. For red <span class="spanb">wine</span>, the entire red grape is used: the must, the skin, the pulp, and even the seeds. The quality of red <span class="spanb">wine</span> is determined by the quality of the red grapes. Therefore, factors such as climate, soil characteristics, and even the pruning techniques used on the vines over the years are important, as they all influence the quality of the grapes.</p>

        <h2 class="whiskybb">four processes to generate and sell a quality <span class="spanb">wine</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="elproceso">the process</h3>
        <p class="vinoparrafo media">The grapes are placed in the press and then in the crusher to extract the must. In the winery, the result of crushing and pressing is stored in stainless steel barrels. Yeast is then added to convert the sugar in the must into alcohol. This process is called fermentation. The fermentation process undergoes constant and continuous monitoring and experiments to improve the quality of red <span class="spanb">wine</span>. This is done by taking samples of the must and mixing them with different types of yeast.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="temperatura">Temperature</h3>
        <p class="ptemperatura media">Another essential point in the production process of red <span class="spanb">wine</span> is the fermentation temperature. In the stainless steel barrel where the fermentation process takes place, temperature control is crucial. Red <span class="spanb">wine</span> must ferment at a temperature between 30°C to 35°C. The fermentation time for this type of <span class="spanb">wine</span> is around 10 days. The production of red <span class="spanb">wine</span> requires an additional step: during fermentation, the tank needs to be drained to aerate the <span class="spanb">wine</span>. Oxygen helps the yeast to work more efficiently during fermentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="elproceso">the controls</h3>
        <p class="vinoparrafo media">The sugar level is also monitored because, during the process, as the sugar level decreases, the alcohol level rises. Fermentation is considered complete when there is virtually no sugar left, and the alcohol level for red <span class="spanb">wine</span> typically ranges between 11% and 13%. Afterwards, the winemaker pumps the <span class="spanb">wine</span> into barrels for proper blending. The <span class="spanb">wine</span> is then stored for a few months and subsequently filtered to remove particles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="temperatura">the bottling</h3>
        <p class="ptemperatura media">Finally, the bottling process takes place, either fully automated, manual, or a combination of both. The key to bottling is to prevent oxygen from entering the bottle, as it can spoil the <span class="spanb">wine</span>. The dark color of the bottle helps preserve the <span class="spanb">wine</span> by protecting it from light, which can affect its flavor. The use of cork as a wine stopper is determined by its ability to seal the bottle tightly, preventing air from entering. Inside the bottle, the <span class="spanb">wine</span> continues to undergo changes as it ages.Red <span class="spanb">wine</span> is made from red grapes (sometimes with a proportion of white grapes) and is fermented in the presence of the grape skins. It can range in color from cherry red to deep purple. Some notable red grape varieties for red <span class="spanb">wine</span> include Tempranillo, Garnacha Tinta, Graciano, Mencía, Monastrell, Cariñena/Grazuelo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Syrah. Depending on the aging period in the barrel and bottle, red <span class="spanb">wine</span> can be classified as young <span class="spanb">wine</span>, crianza, reserva, or gran reserva.</p>

    <h2 class="whiskybb">THREE PHASES TO TASTING A <span class="spanb">wine</span></h2>
    <div>
        <p class="parrafito media"><span class="span1">Visual Phase </span>: Colors and Hues If the first impression is defined through sight, <span class="spanb">wines</span> are no exception. Firstly, good lighting is needed to observe them. On a white background (such as a napkin, tablecloth, or sheet of paper), tilt the glass at a 45° angle to begin appreciating the colors. In this phase, it is important to pay attention to the shades that appear, as their variations can help determine the age of the <span class="spanb">wine</span> and whether it is a young red or white <span class="spanb">wine</span>, or a more evolved one.</p>
        <p class="parrafito media"><span class="span1">Olfactory Phase </span>: Aromas and Bouquets In this stage of tasting, one must rely on olfactory memory, draw on past experiences, and identify aromas that have been previously encountered. These aromas can be classified as primary (fruity), secondary (fermentation-related), and tertiary (aging-related) descriptors. To discover them, the first step is to place your nose into the glass and inhale, perceiving the lighter aromas. After the initial impression, gently swirl the glass multiple times to allow the <span class="spanb">wine</span> to release its less volatile aromatic compounds.</p>
        <p class="parrafito media"><span class="span1">Tasting phase</span> : Flavors and Textures This step is the most enjoyable, as it is when the <span class="spanb">wine</span> is actually tasted. It is on the tongue, through the taste buds, where the four basic tastes are perceived: bitter, acidic, salty, and sweet. However, there is a multitude of flavors that can be found in <span class="spanb">wines</span>, and they are often related to the aromas (fruits, flowers, herbs, among others). In this phase, it is recommended to hold the <span class="spanb">wine</span> in the mouth for a few seconds to perceive its texture, consistency, richness, and body, and begin to decipher the overall impression the <span class="spanb">wine</span> leaves in the mouth. At this stage, one can also evaluate the persistence of the flavors, whether they linger for a short or long time. The concentration of each <span class="spanb">wine</span> is also perceived on the palate, some <span class="spanb">wines</span> being fuller-bodied while others are lighter; for example, if the mouth feels "filled," it is undoubtedly a concentrated <span class="spanb">wine</span>. By following these three steps in tasting, not only will you enjoy the wine more, but you will also be able to discover everything it has to offer: a wide range of sensations that will increase sip after sip.</p>
