    <h1 data-aos="zoom-in" class="pana">the cigar and its origins:</h1>
    <section>
        <p class="parrafo media"> Tobacco is a plant native to South America, and it is said to have reached Cuba between two to three thousand years before our era. The Cuban indigenous people, mostly composed of the Ta√≠no Indians, were faithful consumers of tobacco. For them, it was like a kind of medicine and essential for accompanying social, political, and religious ceremonies, so it formed part of their main crops.
            With the arrival of the Spaniards to Cuba in the early 16th century, the tobacco plant spread throughout the world, instantly sparking a strong passion for it. Spain had the largest number of enthusiasts. It then spread to other parts of Europe, where the most serious sanctions were imposed on tobacco. Interestingly, the more it was prohibited, the more its use expanded for medicinal purposes.</p>

        <p class="parrafo media">The term "habano" is used to refer to all <span class="spanc">cigars</span> or <span class="spanc">cigars</span> in which 100% of the tobacco used is grown and manufactured in Cuba, following multiple and stringent controls at every stage of the agricultural cultivation process, including fermentation, drying, and even aging.</p>

        <h2 class="calidad">It seems like a silly question, but how do you smoke a <span class="spanc">cigar</span>?</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="parrafo2 media">Place the habano between your lips and, while keeping the flame about an inch away from the tip, draw in until the flame reaches the habano. Continue the process of rotating the habano. Gently blow on the lit part of the habano to ensure that it is lit evenly.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="cigarro">People think that it is smoked like a cigarette and it is another world.</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="parrafo3 medi">Do not inhale; it is not a <span class="spanc">cigarette</span>. Draw in gently until the smoke fills your mouth and let it delight your taste buds. Relax and savor the subtle flavors and aromas of the blend in that habano. Do not slide or attempt to remove the band, as you risk tearing the wrapper and ruining your habano. There is no problem in relighting your habano if it goes out. But first, remove any loose ash, or it will be difficult to relight. You can smoke a habano with full enjoyment probably up to three-quarters of its size. Do not worry about the length or the fate of the ash. Do not nervously tap a habano to shake off the ash as one would do with a cigarette. Allow the ash to fall naturally, preferably into an ashtray.</p>
