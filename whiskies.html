    <section>
        <div>
            <p class="parrafo media"><span class="hppp">Whiskey</span> was born in Ireland, and its production quickly spread to Scotland. It is a distilled spirit made from cereal and aged in wooden barrels. The pioneers in distilling it and formalizing the production process were monks, and from them, it passed on to the peasants who set up countless homemade stills.</p>
            <p class="parrafo media">Currently, <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span> is the most prized spirit in the liquor market. In addition to being of great quality, the English spread it throughout the world with its arrival in Canada and the United States, leading to the proliferation of numerous distilleries.</p>

            <p class="pblended media">Imagine that on one side we have a single malt Scotch <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span>; that is, <span class="hppp">whiskeys</span> that have been created in a single distillery using water, yeast, and malted barley. On the other side, we have a single grain Scotch <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span>; meaning it has been created in a single distillery where, in addition to water, other grains like corn, rye, wheat, or barley (it can also be a combination of several) were used. These two blended <span class="hppp">whiskeys</span> can give life to a blended <span class="hppp">whiskey</span>, yes! It's that simple. A blended <span class="hppp">whiskey</span> is the combination of one or more single malt scotches with one or more single grain scotches. This type of <span class="hppp">whiskey</span> is one of the most popular in liquor stores and your favorite bars. In fact, 80% of the blended <span class="hppp">whiskey</span> volume exported worldwide comes from Scotland.</p>

            <img class="imgblended media20 img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="./img/jameson.jpg" alt="jameson whiskey">
            <p class="pblended media">The preparation of Irish <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span>  is made from the mash obtained from cereals. This mixture is usually composed of malted and unmalted barley, along with rye, oats, and wheat. The process is similar to that of Scotch <span class="hppp">Whiskeys</span>. After selecting the grains, each distillery carries out its own specific blend. They are then washed and soaked (hydrated) to undergo germination, a process in which the starches in the grains are converted into soluble sugars. Next, the grains are milled (except those that need to be malted), and after infusion or mashing, the liquid is fermented for approximately 72 hours. Once the wash is obtained, it undergoes three distillations, after which it is aged in oak casks (previously used to store Sherry).</p>

            <p class="pblended media">Bourbon <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span>, or bourbon, is a distilled beverage from the <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span> family that is exclusive to the United States. It is characterized by being slightly aromatic and having a caramel-like flavor. According to US legislation, bourbon must be made primarily from corn, with a concentration between 50% and 70%, with the latter being more common. Other added ingredients may include malted barley, wheat, or rye.
            There are no legal requirements for a minimum aging period for a product to be called bourbon. However, in order to be labeled as "straight bourbon," it must have been aged for a minimum of two years. Additionally, any bourbon aged less than 4 years must state the specific aging period on the label. As a general rule, bourbon is matured for a period of 5 years in oak barrels, which can be new and/or charred.

Some of them only carry out part of the process locally. The Argentine perspective on <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span> often follows the Scottish tradition, or Scotch, and has some influences from bourbon and American <span class="hppp">Whiskey</span>. In the last ten years, the local industry has grown significantly. Here are the most sought-after brands known for their personalized flavors and unique aging methods.</p>
